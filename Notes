Multitasking :
Process based multitasking - VLC and painting
thread based multitasking - ms words and format texting

Two threads share the same address space
context switching between threads is less expensive than switching between process
The cost of communication between thread is relatively low

Multitasking allows idle CPU time to be good to use

At runtime threads in the program exist in common memory space and share data and code . compared to process threads
are lightweight process
They share the process running the program

Main Thread
UserThread
Daemon Thread

JVM never check whether daemon threads has finished the task . it only check user thread before terminating

Thread cannot extend multiple classes  - doesnt support multiple inheritance
But Runnable thread can implement multiple classes - support multiple interfaces
Thread Class: Cannot extend multiple classes (no multiple inheritance of classes).
Runnable Interface: Can be combined with other interfaces, allowing multiple inheritance of types.

best choice is Multiple Interface means Runnable Thread
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Threads vs. Daemon Threads
User Threads:
User threads are primary threads in an application that keep running until they complete or are terminated.
Java applications won’t terminate while any user thread is running;
only when all user threads have completed will the JVM exit.
Daemon Threads:
Daemon threads, in contrast, are background threads supporting user threads.
The JVM automatically terminates daemon threads when all user threads finish execution.
Common daemon threads include garbage collection and monitoring threads in the JVM.
----

In Spring Boot Daemon Thread wont stop even if all user thread ends But in normal java main class daemon thread will stop after
all user ends and exit from JVM
-------
Spring Boot application:
In a Normal Java Application:
When the main() method and all user threads complete, the JVM shuts down.
Any daemon threads still running are terminated automatically when the JVM exits.
The daemon thread stops as expected because the JVM does not wait for daemon threads to finish,
meaning it exits immediately once no user threads remain.
------
In a Spring Boot Application:
Spring Boot starts additional threads to manage the application context,
such as monitoring, auto-configuration, and scheduling threads.
Some of these are user threads that keep the JVM alive until the Spring Boot application context is explicitly closed.
Even if your custom user threads finish, these Spring Boot-managed threads may keep the JVM running,
allowing your daemon threads to continue running as well.
This is why the daemon thread appears not to stop immediately in a Spring Boot application. The Spring container’s background processes keep the JVM alive, preventing it from exiting when your custom user threads end.


Synchronization

Any object can serve as a lock in synchronized blocks, including instances of wrapper classes (e.g., new Integer(1)).
Intrinsic Lock: All synchronized methods in an object share the same intrinsic lock.
Blocking: If one thread holds the lock in any synchronized method, other threads are blocked from accessing any other synchronized method on the same object.
Synchronized Block: Requires an explicit lock object.
Synchronized Method: No explicit lock is required, as it uses the intrinsic lock of the instance.
""
this key word is the lock ======
instance of current class object is used as lock in method level synchronization internally : like (synchronization(this)
 in all synchronized method lock is instance of current class object
 ""


 how to synchronize static method - for static method it wont accept this  - so just use clasname.class in synchronized block
 staticCounter: Belongs to the class, shared across all instances, only one copy exists.
 instanceCounter: Belongs to each individual instance, each instance has its own copy.


 Thread safety - String buffer is thread safe - string builder is not thread safe.

 volatile keyWord - Direct access from RAM not from Cache

 Volatile Variable: private static volatile Singleton singletonInstance = null;
 The volatile keyword ensures that the singletonInstance variable is not cached,
 making sure that every thread reads the latest value of singletonInstance directly from memory.
 This is essential in multithreaded scenarios to prevent multiple threads from creating separate instances.


Synchronization vs Volatile

The volatile keyword in Java ensures that a variable’s value is always read from and written to the main memory,
making sure that all threads have a consistent and up-to-date view of it.
Key Points:
Visibility: Guarantees that changes to a volatile variable are immediately visible to all threads.
Prevents Caching: Ensures threads don't use cached versions of the variable, always fetching the latest value from memory.
No Atomicity: Does not ensure thread-safety for complex operations (e.g., incrementing).
Execution Order: Prevents reordering of read and write operations by the JVM or compiler.

 Producer consumer Pattern
 Producer: A thread that generates data and stores it in a shared buffer.
 Consumer: A thread that consumes data from the shared buffer.
 Buffer: A shared resource (like a queue) where the producer places data, and the consumer removes data.
 Synchronization: To prevent race conditions and ensure the producer and consumer work correctly without interfering with each other.
 Solution Using wait() and notify() in Java
Use a shared buffer and synchronization to manage when the producer or consumer can proceed.
  The producer must wait if the buffer is full, and the consumer must wait if the buffer is empty.

  BlockingQueue automatically handles the blocking and synchronization, eliminating the need for manual wait() and notify() calls.
  The producer will block if the queue is full, and the consumer will block if the queue is empty.

  Provides built-in methods like take() (for consumers) and put() (for producers) which block if the queue is empty (for consumers) or full (for producers).

 Thread states :
 NEW → RUNNABLE: When th is started using th.start().
 RUNNABLE → TIMED_WAITING: When th executes Thread.sleep(1);.
 TIMED_WAITING → RUNNABLE: After the sleep duration ends, th is ready to run again.
 RUNNABLE → TERMINATED: When the run() method completes, and th finishes execution.


 Yield();

 Thread.join

 Thread priorities - default is 5 is norm, min is 1 max is 10 - set priority getPriority()
 Thread Scheduler - Time sliced or Round robin algorithm


 DeadLocks
 Deadlock Detection and Recovery


 Atomic variables and Volatile in java

volatile is generally used to visibility problem - where one thread and see other thread updates from shared cache
Atomic variables
Atomic variables are part of the java.util.concurrent.atomic package and provide atomic (indivisible)
operations on single variables. They guarantee atomicity and visibility without needing locks.

Completable Future:
. What is CompletableFuture?
CompletableFuture is an advanced concurrency utility introduced in Java 8 for building asynchronous and non-blocking programs.
It allows developers to manage tasks that run in the background and provides methods to handle their results or errors.
runAsync: Executes a task without returning a result.
supplyAsync: Executes a task that returns a result.
Both use the ForkJoinPool by default or a custom executor if specified.

Method Types
Transformation:
thenApply: Transforms the result.
thenApplyAsync: Asynchronously transforms the result.
Consumption:
thenAccept: Consumes the result (no transformation).
thenRun: Executes a task without using the result.
Combining:
thenCombine: Combines results of two CompletableFutures.
thenCompose: Chains one future to another based on the result of the first.
. Real-World Applications
Suitable for:
Async I/O operations (e.g., API calls, database queries).
Aggregating results from multiple services.
Reducing response times in distributed systems.
allOf: Waits for all CompletableFutures to complete.
anyOf: Completes when the first CompletableFuture finishes

ForkJoinPool: invoke(obj of recursive extend class) fork() - worker thread compute() - main thread join()
The ForkJoinPool efficiently manages threads to execute tasks in parallel.
Designed to break tasks into smaller subtasks, execute them in parallel, and then combine the results efficiently.


ReentrantReadWriteLock - one write Thread at a time ( same a reentrant lock) - multiple reader threads at a time;
ReentrantLock - only one thread at a time can acquire a lock

ReadWriteLock -
ReadWriteLock is a concurrency utility in Java that optimizes performance for scenarios where read operations are frequent compared to write operations.
It provides two distinct locks:
Read Lock: Allows multiple threads to read concurrently.
Write Lock: Allows only one thread to write, ensuring exclusive access.
Reentrant Locks:
Both the read and write locks are reentrant, meaning the same thread can acquire the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.

Starvation  - indefinite blocking -
a process which is read to run can wait indefinitely because of low priority.
A higher priority process prevent a low priority process from eve getting the CPU.
Solution is Aging:::
- method to ensure that process with lower priority will eventually complete their execution.
 by gradually increase the priority of process that wait in the system for a long time
