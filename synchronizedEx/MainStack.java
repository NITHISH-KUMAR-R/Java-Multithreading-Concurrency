        //Lock - we can use all Wrapper objects as lock Integer,String and Object anything  - but not primitive types
        //if we let t1 acquire lock first to complete all 10 iterations we need to
        //do changes in start t1.start() , t1.join(), t2.start() this way we are telling first complete t1 and then move to t2.

        //ðŸ”¹ Every object in Java has a built-in lock (also called a monitor).
